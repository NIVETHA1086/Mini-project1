Project Case on Advanced Data Analytics

Project Description:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on product/brand comparison for E-Commerce.

The project should include all the process of data analysis:

• Data Collection using web scarping

• Data Cleansing

• Finding Missing data

• Error analysis

• Data Transformation

• Data Wrangling

• Data Visualization

• Inferential Statistics 

Website : FLIPKART

Python libraries :

NumPy - package for scientific computing with Python

Pandas - fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool
To extract and analyze insights from datasets.

Data Visualization libraries :

Matplotlib - a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
for designing plot and graphs.

Seaborn - statistical data visualization - to improve the style of plots/graphs.

Data Collection :

Collecting the data through web-scrapping from flipkart website. Data collected of two brands( Lenovo & ASUS).

Web Scraping :

Web Scraping is a process of extracting data from a website. And, we use this method to collect data by scraping the HTML code from the particular website.

Data Cleansing :

Data Cleansing is the process of analyzing data for finding incorrect, corrupt, and missing values and abluting it to make it suitable for input to data analytics and various machine learning algorithms.

Finding Missing Data :

Analysing the missing data values and filling it with appropriate value.

Error Analysis :

Analysis the error in the data like data types/ data structure etc.

Data Transformation :

The process where we transform our data into the required format. Changing the structure of data mapping to different parameters or converting to other data format.

Data wrangling :

Data wrangling is a term often used to describe the early stages of the data analytics process. It involves transforming and mapping data from one format into another.

Data visualizations :

Data visualizations are used to discover unknown facts and trends. It convert large and small data sets into visuals, which is easy to understand and process for humans.

the representation of information in the form of a chart, diagram, picture, etc. It can also be used as a reporting tool.

Inferential Statistics :

It takes data from sample and make generalizations about a population. It hepls to analysis if the dataset is very large. Hypothesis testing and estimation works in this process.

Conclusion:

The above analysis has two brands of 'Lenovo' and'ASUS' . We have performed EDA process on it. The process involves Data Collecting -> Data Cleaning -> Data Manupilation -> Data Comparison -> Data Visulatization -> Data Presentation.

After completion of all the step , we conclude that the two brand products are analyzed on different parameter like "Rating","Price","Discount".

From the comparison of both the brand and there dependent parameters we conclude "ASUS" brand as a cost effective compared to that of "Lenovo "brand.

According to our analysis "AUSU" is the best choice compared to "Lenovo".
